## Visual design matters A LOT.

Your job title is "designer" first. Especially in an era where models can generate mediocre work using component libraries, it is more important than ever to show that you understand the fundamental things that make things look good. Typography and spacing are the foundation. If you can make simple type and space look good, that's something! This is why, surprisingly, resumes are really difficult to design well — they are so barebones and minimal that the small details really shine through (or feel lackluster).

## Learn to code, but don't lose the craft.

There's a trap where you start coding and suddenly everything becomes about "can I build this?" instead of "should I design this?" Keep your design eye sharp. Sketch before you code. The best design engineers I know still start with pen and paper.

## Sweat the details nobody asked for.

The micro-interactions, the loading states, the empty states, the error messages — these are where great design lives. Nobody puts "design the 404 page" in the project brief, but it's the stuff that makes people smile. Care about the things that aren't on the checklist.
